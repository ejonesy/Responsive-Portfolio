                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>If you like nicknames, I also go by Steve. I came to web development by way of food service and retail with a generous sprinkle of arts and humanities. I've made art my whole life (that I can remember) and always enjoyed art history and literature, so I studied them in college. To support myself I learned how to make fancy lattes and delicious cocktails, and learned some of the secrets of French and Italian wines. I took that as far as I was willing until I decided to pursue coding somewhat out of the blue one day. I couldn't be happier! For me coding is like figuring out puzzles while also creating something awesome that people will enjoy. I like getting to code from home so I can hang out with my cat.</p>
